# Ediininja: Slice your way to calorie awareness!

**Ediininja** is a fun and educational mobile game inspired by Fruit Ninja, designed to help children understand the calorie content of different foods. By slicing delicious fruits, veggies, and treats, kids learn about healthy choices while enjoying an engaging gameplay experience.

## How it works:

- **Progressive difficulty:** The game starts with just one food item on screen, gradually increasing to 10 items by the 90-second mark. This dynamic pace keeps players challenged and engaged.
- **Projectile motion:** Foods follow a realistic projectile trajectory as they rise and fall, adding an extra layer of complexity and fun to the slicing action.
- **Calorie awareness:** Each sliced food displays its calorie count, allowing children to learn about the nutritional value of their choices in a playful way.

## Technology stack:

- **React Native CLI:** Ediininja is built as a React Native CLI app, making it easy to develop and deploy for Android devices.
- **TypeScript:** The codebase utilizes TypeScript for strong typing and improved maintainability.
- **Matter.js:** This popular physics engine powers the game's interactive elements, ensuring realistic and satisfying slicing mechanics.

## Open for contributions:

This repo is deliberately made public to welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help improve the game. Whether you have coding expertise, creative ideas for new levels or foods, or simply want to share feedback. Please note that credit must be given for any contributions made outside this repo.

## Getting started on Android:

1. Clone the Ediininja repository from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/psalishol/ediininja.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm.

Make sure you have set up [React Native Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or yarn (depending on your choice) configured before running the above commands.


## iOS support:

The project is not yet configured for ios, might do in the nearest future, Stay tuned for updates!

## Possible inclusions for further development:

- **Leaderboards:** Encourage competition and motivate healthy habits with leaderboards that track players' calorie-slicing achievements.
- **Educational mini-games:** Integrate short, interactive educational games about nutrition and healthy choices within the gameplay experience.
- **Customization:** Allow players to unlock different ninja characters, backgrounds, and slicing effects to personalize their gameplay.

**Ediininja** is a promising project with the potential to make learning about healthy eating fun and engaging for children!
