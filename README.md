## Ediininjaü•∑üèø‚öîÔ∏è

**Ediininja** is a fun and educational mobile game inspired by Fruit Ninja, designed to help children understand the calorie content of different foods. By slicing delicious fruits, veggies, and treats, kids learn about healthy choices while enjoying an engaging gameplay experience.

### üßë‚Äçüíª How it works:

- **Progressive difficulty:** The game starts with just one food item on screen, gradually increasing to 10 items by the 90-second mark. This dynamic pace keeps players challenged and engaged.
- **Projectile motion:** Foods follow a realistic projectile trajectory as they rise and fall, adding an extra layer of complexity and fun to the slicing action.
- **Calorie awareness:** Each sliced food displays its calorie count, allowing children to learn about the nutritional value of their choices in a playful way.
